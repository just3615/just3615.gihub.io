        I am a current student at the University of California, Riverside, pursuing a degree in Business Sociology. With a keen interest in understanding the complex dynamics between businesses and societies, I am passionate about exploring how organizations can operate responsibly and sustainably while driving positive social change. My academic journey at UCR has equipped me with a strong foundation in both business principles and sociological theories. I have delved into subjects such as organizational behavior, corporate social responsibility, and economic sociology, allowing me to develop a well-rounded perspective on the multifaceted interactions between businesses and their surrounding communities. Beyond the classroom, I have actively sought opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world settings. I have been involved in various extracurricular activities and internships, where I have had the chance to collaborate with diverse teams and contribute to meaningful projects. These experiences have not only enhanced my understanding of the business world but have also honed my skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication.
        <br><br>
        In addition to my volunteer work, I have held leadership roles in various jobs, where I honed my ability to lead and inspire teams. As a Student Office Assistant at the UC Riverside Biology Department, I provided administrative support and helped coordinate departmental events, demonstrating my organizational skills and attention to detail. My role as a Restaurant Shift Manager at In-N-Out Burger allowed me to develop strong team management skills, ensuring efficient operations and high customer satisfaction.These experiences have deepened my commitment to social responsibility and leadership. I am motivated to seek opportunities where I can leverage my business knowledge and leadership skills to drive positive change and create a more equitable and sustainable world.
        <br><br>
        As I look ahead to the future, I am excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead. I am eager to continue learning, growing, and making a meaningful impact in the world of business sociology. Whether it's through further academic pursuits, professional experiences, or community involvement, I am dedicated to using my skills and knowledge to drive positive change and create a more equitable and sustainable world. In summary, my journey at UCR has been one of discovery, growth, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge and impact. I am driven by a passion for understanding and improving the intricate relationship between businesses and society. With a strong academic background, practical experience, and a deep commitment to social responsibility, I am poised to embark on a career that merges business excellence with a profound sense of social purpose.
